Welcome! This is documentation for dep, the "official experiment" dependency management tool for the Go language. Dep is a tool intended primarily for use by developers, to support the work of actually writing and shipping code. It is not intended for end users who are installing Go software - that's what `go get` does.

This site has both guides and reference documents. The guides are practical explanations of how to actually do things with dep, whereas the reference material provides deeper dives on specific topics. Of particular note is the [glossary](#glossary.md) - if you're unfamiliar with terminology used in this documentation, make sure to check there!
